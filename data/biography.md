I am currently a senior underguaduate student at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://cs.hitsz.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html), advised by Prof. [Qing Liao](http://liaoqing.me/). I will then go to the [Information Hub](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/information-hub), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/) as a Ph.D. student under the guidance of Prof. [Wei WANG](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwcs/).

My research interests include **Knowledge Graphs**, **Graph Neural Networks** and applications of **Hyperbolic Space** on them. Recently, I have been very interested in the application of machine learning to solve **PDE**s (such as **Physics Informed Neural Network**) in cross fields.
