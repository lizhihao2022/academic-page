# Zhihao LI's Homepage

The website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and can be deployed on [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

**Easy to use**

you can just change the config file and deploy it on Vercel which is a free platform and well supports Next.js.

**Concise**

See my [website](https://lizhihao.me) and [demo] as examples.
